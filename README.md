# MySQL Workbench and Power BI Industries-Layoffs-Analysis(2020-2023)

## Project Overview :
In this project I explore the industry layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 1,995 records from 2020 to 2023.

## Process:

- Data Cleaning 
  I cleaned data through the use of modify and update functions to handle inconsistencies, standardize formats, and address missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
  I Performed initial Exploratory Data Analysis to discover trends and patterns through the dataset.

### Tool used: 
*MySQL Workbench

### Techniques used: 
*Data Type Conversion, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs.*  

## Findings:
- Layoffs happened from March 2020 to March 2023, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and Microsoft had the highest number of layoffs.
- The Consumer and Retail industries were hit the hardest.
- The United States had far more layoffs than any other country.
- Companies that had already gone public did the most layoffs to cut costs.
- Some well-funded companies that raised millions, like Katerra, shut down completely and let everyone go.

## Summary:  
Data reveals that from 2021 on, major US-based tech and retail companies that had gone public were responsible for the most significant layoffs.
