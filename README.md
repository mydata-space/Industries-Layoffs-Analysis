## Process:

- Data Cleaning & EDA in MySQL:
  I Performed initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning to handle inconsistencies, standardize formats, and address missing values.
- Visualization in Power BI:
  I Created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends, filter by industry and country, and communicate key findings effectively.

### Tool used: 
*MySQL Workbench and Power BI*

### Techniques used: 
*Data Type Conversion, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs.*  

## Findings:
- Layoffs happened from March 2020 to March 2023, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and Microsoft had the highest number of layoffs.
- The Consumer and Retail industries were hit the hardest.
- The United States had far more layoffs than any other country.
- Companies that had already gone public did the most layoffs to cut costs.
- Some well-funded companies that raised millions, like Katerra, shut down completely and let everyone go.

## Summary:  
Data reveals that from 2021 on, major US-based tech and retail companies that had gone public were responsible for the most significant layoffs.
